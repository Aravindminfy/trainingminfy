# Brief Explanation of How the Git Conflict Was Resolved
* A Git conflict occurs when two branches modify the same part of a file and Git canâ€™t decide which change to keep during a merge.

Here in my code : <br>
 feature-subtract added a subtract() method.

 feature-multiply added a multiply() method.

* Both branches edited the same place in calculator.py (after the add() method), so Git couldn't automatically merge them.

* I manually resolved all the conflicts by removing the extra lines, or by using VS Code's GUI to select 'Accept Both Changes'
